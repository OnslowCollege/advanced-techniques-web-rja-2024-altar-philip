            The Social life for adolescents is an important part of their life as it has a huge impact on them as majority of
            young people often spend huge amounts of time around others. The benefits of having a good social connection with
            others, is that it lowers the rate of developing anxiety and depression. This also raises a personâ€™s self-esteem,
            and having the feeling of being truly supported has a great impact on health in general. It also helps the people
            who struggle with social interactions to make friends.
        
            During the teenage years, almost every teen has an identity crisis, as in they do not know what their personal
            identity is when being in a friend group. This is because the use of social media, peers, and family views can make
            this a problematic or suppressed situation. Other factors that an adolescent may be under like alcohol, drug abuse,
            eating disorders connect themselves to have higher rates of identity-related problems. There have been studies that
            connect the severity of depressive symptoms and identity confusion scores.

            Global issues (such as climate change, the war in Ukraine and COVID-19) are also affecting the youth. Global issues
            like climate change are affecting the youth because they fear what their future would be like, same thing as for the
            war in Ukraine, they are losing confidence about their futures, which is supplying higher levels of anxiety and
            depression. COVID-19 is affecting their mental health, how this happens is because of the isolations that they need
            to perform. What this does is that it makes them fall behind and miss out on school work, and amongst young people,
            worries and fear about the virus was associated with their well-being, and with this worry and fear increasing, they
            also have an increase in depression, anxiety and the feeling of low quality of life.
        
            A suggestion about a solution that we can all do to help people who are struggling with their mentality because of
            situations like what was mentioned can be supporting them and encouraging them. Now this can be from small simple
            talks where the person who is struggling opens up to their friends so they can be relieved of some of the stress
            that they are experiencing and know that they are being supported, to people heavily supporting them by always
            keeping them company and assisting in any way possible with their problems.
