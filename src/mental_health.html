            First off, what is Mental Illness? Mental illness is a condition in a person's mental wellbeing, causing disorder to
            their behavior and thinking capabilities.
        
            How it happens if a person were to develop mental illness, it would begin from a situation or problem that occurred
            whether it is at home with family, at school with friends or teachers, or at their workplaces with their co-workers,
            these places could be the start to where the spark is first lit up of a person developing mental illness. If the
            issues from where they first appeared does not get sorted out and is significantly affecting the personâ€™s mental
            health in a negative way, then there is a high possibility that the person may develop mental illness and they
            should go and seek professional help. If the problem gets solved or it does not bother the person, then they will
            have a low chance of developing mental illness however they should still check with someone as a precaution so it
            does not develop into something bigger later on.

            If a person were to have mental illness, what would they be experiencing?
        
            Things that people are experiencing when having mental illness can be:
            Anxiety Disorders
            Bipolar Disorder
            Depression
            PTSD
            Schizofrenia
            Eating Disorders
            Disruptive Behavior and Dissocial Disorders
            Neurodevelopmental Disorders
        
        
            1 in every 8 people worldwide is under a type of mental illness condition. If we put this into perspective, in 2019,
            970 million people worldwide were living with a mental illness condition. In 2020, the count rose drastically
            because of COVID - 19, with initial reports which estimated a 26% and 28% increase in cases of anxiety and major
            depressive disorders in one year. Options that give effective treatment and prevention for these cases, most people
            do not have available access to these treatments, and many others experience stigma, discrimination and violation of
            human rights.
