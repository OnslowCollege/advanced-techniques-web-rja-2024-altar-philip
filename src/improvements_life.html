            What negatively affects adolescents' mental health?
        
            What affects adolescents' mental health negatively is from the tough and difficult problems that occur within the
            environment that they are in, such as school, home, work and so on. If the situation they are in is too difficult,
            they may be develop signs of stress, depression, anxiety or other kinds of negative mental health, which could
            possibly lead to suicidal thoughts if left un-noticed or untreated.
        
            But that’s what we would think on how young people develop negative mental health, what’s the more realistic answer
            to this?
        
            Well, an adolescent's mentality can be negatively affected by the things that were already pointed out before, but
            there are a number of other reasons as to what can negatively affect a teenagers’ mind and how it negatively affects
            them.
        
            Reasons like, Brain Development during adolescence stages and common struggling mental health factors in the teenage
            stages, such as sleep, technology and the digital age, Diet and Nutrition, their social life and parenting.

            Sleep is an important thing for teenagers, they require large amounts of sleep. What lack of sleep does to teenagers
            is that it can lead to irritability, difficulty in concentrating and may also increase impulsivity and even
            depression.
        
            Why this can occur in a teenager is because their brain is still developing and since that the teenage stage is an
            important stage of a person’s life, “they are more open to risky behavior”.
        
            Teenagers need an average of around 9-10 hours of sleep per night. But most teenagers do not get this required sleep
            time, because of hanging out with friends or having to deal with school work. So a solution for getting a teenager
            to achieve more sleep during school days after school, is helping them with their work so they can finish faster and
            sleep earlier and wake up earlier with their required amount of sleep. If they are hanging out with their friends,
            they can be laid back slightly but at least have a time limit to how long they can be with each other so they do not
            compromise their sleep schedule.
        
            In short, parents that are either overprotective or reject their children will affect their child’s psychology
            negatively.
        
            A solution for this is just to take better care of them. How parents can take better care of their children is by
            spending more time with their offspring, being more trustworthy with their children and educating them about trust,
            and the same thing has to go with the children too, spending more time with them and having an understanding of
            their parents on why they do certain actions. Because if only the parents are putting an effort on wanting to change
            their habits but their child doesn’t, then the parents will feel as though they are being taken advantage of.
