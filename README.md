## Web Template

Use this template to develop a website in HTML and CSS.

This template includes:

- Basic web development folder structure (`img`, `css`, etc.)
- Extensions to help write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Live Preview for static websites (if it does not work, click on the 𝌆 button at the top right → Open In Browser)
- Integration for diagrams.net (for files ending in `.drawio`)
- Integrated image editor

## How to run your code

Once your Codespace has loaded, you can open your project in the following ways:

### Static websites

- click on the Live Server icon at the bottom-right. This will load `index.html`.

### NodeJS (TypeScript) code

- click on Terminal menu, select "Run Build Task", then click "npm: start:watch". This will load `index.ts`.

In either case, click on the prompt that appears at the bottom right to open your website in a browser window. Your website will update **automatically** whenever you save your files (Ctrl/Cmd-S); **you do not need to restart Live Server or run the build task again**!
